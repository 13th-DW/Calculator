Hi!

This is my first module and for practice I made somekind of calculator that can calculate numbers in one numBase and return answer in another.

Im modules folder you can see file inputs.py that takes all inputs from user (first num, second num and operator), check if number corresponds numBase that you choose.
Then you can see file convertor.py. Here we have input number of Base and convertor from one to another.

By main.py we start work with calculator.

Enjoy!
